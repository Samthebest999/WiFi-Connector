# WiFi-Connector
This is the tool you use when your Wi-Fi Menu is acting wierd on windows.
For example if your wifi windows is not showing any networks but you know there are.
Or it is not connecting to a network for some weird reason. (If you don't know the password this won't work! THIS IS NOT A HACKING TOOL!)
This only connects to networks that you have previously connected to.
All you need is python installed NOTHING else.
If you want to have the best experience then installing python with PATH and the PY Launcher would be best.
